A ray of light shines down on a leather-bound storybook. The book opens and a voice begins
reading its text:

SHREK: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of
a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first [[kiss]]. She was locked away in a
castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free
her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the
highest room of the tallest tower. For her true love and true love's first kiss.

The voice laughs. A big, green hand rips out a page of the book and shuts it closed.

SHREK: Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - [[]]

We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a [[toilet]] flushing. Out steps SHREK, an ogre,
who tugs at his [[underwear]] and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He
looks lovingly at the swamp he calls home, and goes about his daily routine. This includes
taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant
slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign.

In a nearby village, an angry mob gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their
torches and pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. Shrek
sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside
Shrek's home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them.

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

Villager 1: Think it's in there?

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your [[bones]] for its bread.

Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob.

SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.

The mob gasp.

SHREK: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled
skin...

Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear.

Villagers: No!

SHREK: They'll shave your [[liver]]. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's
quite good on toast.

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and
pinches the flame, extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it.

Villager 1: Right...

Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his [[spit]] extinguishing all
the remaining torches. He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop screaming.

SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.

All: (Screaming!!!)

Shrek laughs as the men drop their torches and pitchforks and run away as fast they can.

SHREK: And stay out!

He looks down and picks up a wanted poster dropped by one of the villagers. He reads
it aloud.

SHREK: "Wanted. Fairytale [[creatures]]"?

He sighs and walks off, dropping the poster to the ground.
